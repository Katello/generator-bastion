## Setup Development Environment

The generator can be setup from git such that as changes are made to the code those changes can be tried in real time.
After you have cloned the git repository, change into the generator's directory and then do a local install.

```
sudo npm install -g yo
cd generator-bastion
sudo npm link
```

The command `yo bastion` should now be globally available on your system.
Finish the setup by installing the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Testing

To run the full test suite:

```
grunt mochaTest
```

## Linting

We use (eslint)[eslint.org] to lint our JS files. To run:

```
grunt eslint
```
